This project examines how urban form, infrastructure, environmental, and socio-economic drivers interact to shape an overall urban sustainability score.

It combines predictive modeling, trade-off analysis, and interactive scenario simulation to support exploratory and policy-relevant insights.

## Model Trade-offs and Interaction Effects
